task shuffle:

to start run taskshuffle-server from your root task directory - it runs on port 1337 so go to 
http://127.0.0.1:1337 in your browser to see the interface.

**TODO add notion of passing in port and other settings to server

reads .task files 

human readable format so you can still edit w/ vim or what not

just add tasks, separated by line, completed tasks commented out w/ # at start

e.g.

first task
second task
#done task

and you're done. It scans all sub-dirs from location it started and lists them in upper right
